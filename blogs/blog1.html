      <h1>A Tree of Protocols</h1>
      <p>Trees</p>
            Trees can be characterized by the amount of children per node. For example, a binary search tree (BST) allows each node to have only two children. This type of representation comes in handy often. Lets say we want to create a structure to hold all students enrolled in a university. To do this, we might alphabetize the students and arrange them such that the left branch of the tree holds students with names A-N and the right half hold those M-Z. In this way, when we want to know more about a student with a last name F, we must only search half the tree. Therefore, this structure may provide us more efficient search algorithms. 
            
            In Haskell, this structure may appear as follows: 
            
            <pre>
                <code>
                  data Tree a = Leaf | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            A tree can either be empty or have some elements. For that reason, we must include an  `empty` constructor. The other constructor we need is one that allows us to actually build the tree. This is the `Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)`. As you may notice, this is a recursive constructor that attaches a value to a node as well as a pointer to the left a right branch. In a tree of last names, if we only have one last name, the tree would appear as: 

            <pre>
              <code>
                nameTree = Node "Fritz" (Leaf) (Leaf) 
              </code>
          </pre>
