        <p>Trees</p>
            Trees can be characterized by the amount of children per node. For example, a binary search tree (BST) allows each node to have only two children. This type of representation comes in handy often. Lets say we want to create a structure to hold all students enrolled in a university. To do this, we might alphabetize the students and arrange them such that the left branch of the tree holds students with names A-N and the right half hold those M-Z. In this way, when we want to know more about a student with a last name F, we must only search half the tree. Therefore, this structure may provide us more efficient search algorithms. 
            
            In Haskell, this structure may appear as follows: 
            
            data Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
            
            A tree can either be empty or have some elements. For that reason, we must include an  `empty` constructor.
